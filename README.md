# Plunder!

A clicker game for Academies Hacks '23

## Inspiration

I was inspired by a similar game my friend made in middle school.

## What it does

It is a fun game that you can spend your free time on.

## How I built it

I built it with Svelte/TS.

## Challenges I ran into

My main challenge was just making it look nice. I can write code that works, but UI design isn't my forte.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud that I got everything written and working in only a few hours. 

## What I learned

I learned how to write working code fast. I usually spend a lot of time looking at possible solutions and planning out what I want to do. This leads to good code, but takes a lot of time. With Plunder, I just started writing code and doing whatever works since I was on a time crunch. In the end, I'm proud of all that I got done.

## What's next for Plunder

I will definitely be adding more pirates. The pirate selection is kind of lacking right now. I will also be adding more color since it is a bit bland. Finally, I want to make it a bit more functional by having it save everything you bought so that all your progress isn't erased when you refresh the page.
